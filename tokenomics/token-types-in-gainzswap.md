# ðŸª™ Token Types in GainzSwap

The GainzSwap protocol leverages a unique token system designed to power its ecosystem of decentralised trading, liquidity provisioning, and governance. Three primary tokens serve distinct but interconnected roles within the platform:

***

## 1. **$dEDU** â€“ Delegated EDU

$dEDU is the delegated, GainzSwap-native representation of $EDU, enabling users to delegate their $EDU staking while remaining active participants in the protocol. While still earning Yuzu rewards, $dEDU holders:

* **Help grow protocol liquidity**, and
* **Unlock deeper integration** across GainzSwap, including swapping and governance influence.

Swaps involving EDU are settled in $dEDU, and withdrawals back to $EDU are available with a \~2-day unbonding period.

***

## 2. **$Gainz** â€“ Native Protocol Token

$Gainz is the lifeblood of GainzSwap, serving as the native utility and incentive token:

* Distributed primarily to **GToken holders** as farming rewards
* Capped at **21 million tokens** total supply
* Used for **paying swap fees**, which are **burned**, reducing circulating supply
* Grants **governance power** when staked indirectly through liquidity pools

The tokenomics also allocates portions to team, growth initiatives, and ecosystem incentives, ensuring long-term protocol sustainability.

***

## 3. **GToken** â€“ Staked Liquidity Representation

GToken is a **semi-fungible token (SFT)** that represents staked LP positions on GainzSwap. It encodes both:

* The amount of liquidity provided
* The **yield-bearing** position status including lockup duration and value

GToken holders receive $Gainz emissions and can optionally **lock their GTokens** for enhanced rewards. Locked positions can be unlocked at any time, but **early unlocks may incur penalties**.

Future use cases include **governance staking**, **collateralisation**, and cross-platform integrations within the EDU Chain ecosystem.
