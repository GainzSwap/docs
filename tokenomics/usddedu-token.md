# $dEDU Token



$dEDU is the delegated version of $EDU exclusively created on the GainzSwap protocol. It’s not just another token—it’s the conduit that enables you to delegate your $EDU and actively contribute to the platform’s liquidity, participate in Initial Liquidity Offerings (ILOs), and earn Gainz points over time. By converting, or engaging in activities that converts your $EDU to $dEDU, you become an integral part of a system that ensures sustained liquidity for the entire EDU Chain ecosystem.

## **Key Benefits of Holding $dEDU**

## **Understanding the Unbonding Process**

When it’s time to revert your $dEDU back to $EDU, you’ll experience an unbonding period of approximately 2 days. Here’s why this short wait is a boon for the entire ecosystem:

* **Ensuring Liquidity Stability:**\
  The unbonding period helps prevent sudden liquidity drains, ensuring that there’s always enough depth in the pools to support smooth trading. This safeguard stabilizes the market and enhances the overall performance of the protocol.
* **Protecting the Ecosystem:**\
  By implementing a brief wait, we protect against rapid, destabilizing transactions that could harm both the protocol and its users. This measured approach keeps the system robust and secure for long-term growth.
* **A Commitment to Quality:**\
  The delay isn’t a drawback—it’s a strategic feature. It reinforces our commitment to maintain a healthy, dynamic ecosystem where every action is balanced against the needs of the community.

## **How $dEDU Enhances Your GainzSwap Experience**

When you convert your $EDU to $dEDU, you’re contributing to much more than your personal portfolio. Here’s how your participation impacts the broader community:

* **Liquidity Growth:**\
  The total supply of $dEDU is a critical factor in determining the emission rate of $GAINZ tokens, which are distributed to GToken holders (liquidity stakers). In essence, the more $dEDU in circulation, the stronger and more attractive our liquidity pools become.
* **Community-Driven Value:**\
  $dEDU is designed to empower you as a community member. It creates a direct link between personal participation and the overall health of GainzSwap. Every value of $dEDU reinforces the protocol, drives rewards, and paves the way for future innovations.
