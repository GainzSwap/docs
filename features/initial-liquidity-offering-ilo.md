# Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO)



The GainzSwap **Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO)** is a fair and community-driven method for listing tokens on GainzSwap with deep, sustained liquidity from day one.

We help project teams bootstrap liquidity in a transparent and effective way, while giving users early access to promising tokens â€” all without private sales or VC allocations.

***

### ðŸš€ What Is an ILO?

An ILO is a decentralised token launch model where:

* A project contributes a portion of their token supply
* Users contribute accepted tokens (like $GAINZ or $EDU)
* After the offering ends, both sides are **paired into a liquidity pool** on GainzSwap

The result? Immediate trading, price discovery, and zero rug-pull risk.

***

### ðŸ’¡ Why Use GainzSwap ILO?

For Projects:

* Launch with guaranteed liquidity
* Community-driven price discovery

For Participants:

* Early access to new tokens
* Transparent and permissionless launch process
* Guaranteed listing post-campaign

> Unlike traditional IDOs, the liquidity from ILO is locked at launch, preventing early dumps or rug pulls. ILO participants receive GTokens, hence allowing them participate in GainzSwap's and partner governance

***

### ðŸ§¾ How It Works

1.  **Create an ILO campaign**

    * Projects submit details (token address, total allocation, soft/hard caps, duration)

2.  **Users participate**

    * Contribute accepted token (e.g., $EDU) to the ILO pool

3. **Offering ends**
   * Tokens and accepted tokens are automatically paired as liquidity
   * Liquidity is locked for a set period (e.g., 6 months)
4. **Participants receive GTokens**
   * You can participate in governance and receive rewards
