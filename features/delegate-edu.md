# Delegate $EDU

## Delegate $EDU

Delegating $EDU is how you contribute to the security and decentralisation of the **EDU Chain** while earning passive income.

By staking your $EDU tokens with a validator through GainzSwap’s interface, you:

* Help secure the network
* Earn staking rewards
* Retain full control of your tokens

***

### 🎯 Why Delegate?

Validators keep the EDU Chain running securely by producing blocks and validating transactions.

Delegators (that’s you!) support validators by locking up your $EDU tokens with them. In return, you receive a share of the validator’s rewards.

Benefits of delegating:

* Earn $EDU staking rewards
* Support decentralisation
* Retain ownership of your tokens (non-custodial)
* Participate in network governance (coming soon)

***

### 🪙 How to Delegate Your $EDU

1. Visit the [Delegate](https://gainzswap.xyz/stake) page
2. Connect your wallet
3. View available validators and their commission rates
4. Choose one and enter the amount of $EDU to delegate
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

Once confirmed, your $EDU will be staked, and you’ll start earning rewards right away!

***

### 💰 Staking Rewards

* Rewards are distributed in $EDU
* Compounded block by block
* Can be claimed at any time (based on validator settings)

The reward rate depends on:

* The total $EDU staked across the network
* Validator performance and uptime
* Validator commission

> Some validators charge a commission (e.g. 5%–10%) — this is their cut from your earned rewards.

***

### 🔓 Unstaking Your $EDU

Want to stop delegating? You can unstake at any time.

* Unstaking takes **7 days** (unbonding period)
* During this time, your tokens are locked but not earning rewards
* After 7 days, you can withdraw your $EDU

***

### 🧠 Tips for Delegators

* Delegate to multiple validators to diversify your stake
* Choose validators with good uptime and low commission
* Reinvest rewards periodically for compounding
* Monitor validator status to avoid slashing risks

***

### ⚠️ What is Slashing?

If a validator misbehaves (e.g., double signs or stays offline), a portion of their staked $EDU (and yours) may be **slashed**.

Avoid slashing by:

* Delegating to well-reputed, active validators
* Staying up to date with validator performance
